Hi, I'm Ghost! I'm 30 years old and a neophyte programmer just getting into the fascinating world of coding. Since the beginning of my journey, I have become familiar with languages such as C#, Python, and Java. I am fascinated by the potential of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and am looking to further my knowledge in these areas.

My curiosity also led me towards game development, where I started experimenting with Unity 3D. I am always looking for new challenges and enjoy constantly learning. Beyond that, I am interested in exploring many other aspects of programming and technology, because I believe there is always something new to learn and apply.

I am passionate about acquiring new skills to grow both professionally and personally, and I am excited about contributing to the world of technology in innovative ways.
